## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/talentlessDeveloper/nexascale-mentor.git
   ```

2. Switch to the development branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

4. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b yourNameDev e.g kareemDev
   ```
5. Make your changes then add and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```
6. Push your changes to the repository:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin yourNameDev e.g kareemDev
   ```
  After setting the upstream branch using -u, subsequent pushes can be done with:
   ```bash
   git push 
   ```


## Development Workflow

- The `dev` branch is the main development branch. Collaborators should base their work on this branch.
- The `main` branch is protected. All changes must go through the `dev` branch before being merged into `main`.
